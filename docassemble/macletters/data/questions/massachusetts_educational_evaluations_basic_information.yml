question: |
  Welcome to MAC's Request for Initial Special Education Evaluation Interview.
subquestion: |
  The following questions will help you write a letter to request a school special education evaluation for your child or a child that you know.  
  You might want to request a school {evaluation} if you think your child or a child that you know needs services to learn.
  If you want to speak to a person before deciding if you want to request an evaluation, you can call or send an email to our  [Helpline](https://massadvocates.org/helpline/) at Massachusetts Advocates for Children.  
  
  It might take up to 3 business days for a person to respond to your call or email. 

  [Massachusetts Advocates for Children Helpline](https://massadvocates.org/helpline/)

  These questions will take approximately **15 minutes** to fill out. When done, you can email the letter directly to the school district by email 
  or you can print the letter and bring it to the school yourself.

  **IMPORTANT!** If you bring it to the school be sure print a copy for yourself. 
  If you can’t print a copy for yourself, when you bring the letter to the school, ask them to make a copy for you to keep for your records.

  evaluation: |
    An evaluation is testing that a specialist does to see how your child is learning and developing. The specialist may also recommend services and supports for your child as part of their educational programming. An evaluation is sometimes called an assessment.
